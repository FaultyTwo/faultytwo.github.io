                I go by the name of “FaultyTwo” on the Internet.<br>
                But you can call me “Win”. Weird name, I know.

                I'm from a tourist-centralism country called "Thailand".
                <br><br>
                I'm a software developer working for a company.
                And also ... kind of a "content creator" too.
                <br><br>
                My hobbies include playing video games (for fun, not for stress),
                reading books and e-books (prefer non-fiction),
                video editing, and programming, of course.
                <br><br>
                As you can tell, I'm kind of a nerd.
                <br><br>
                I'm pretty introvert due to I don't like being nosed around 
                too many times. But mostly because of my stuttering
                in speech, which used to shattered by confidence in anything.
                <br><br>
                But I know how to handle them properly.
                So it shouldn't be a major problem anymore.
                <br><br>
                As currently. I'm aiming to make a life worth something,
                in both short-term and long-term.
