                I know you have a few questions about me (or not).<br>
                Let's get to know each other.

                I go by the name of <span class="span-hl">"FaultyTwo"</span> on the Internet.<br>
                But you can call me <span class="span-hl">"Win"</span>. Weird name, I know.
            </div>
            <div class="qa-head">Q: Tell me more about yourself.</div>
            <div class="qa-ans">
                I'm from a tourist-centralism country called <span class="span-th">"Thailand"</span>.
                <br><br>
                I'm a software developer working for a company.
                And also ... kind of a <span class="span-hl">"niche internet micro celebrity"</span> too.
                <br><br>
                My hobbies include <span class="span-hl">playing</span> video games (for fun, not for stress),
                <span class="span-hl">reading</span> books and e-books (prefer non-fiction),
                <span class="span-hl">video editing</span>, <span class="span-hl">producing music</span> 
                and <span class="span-hl">programming</span>, of course.
                <br><br>
                As you can tell, I'm kind of a nerd.
                <br><br>
                I'm pretty introvert due to I don't like being nosed around 
                too many times. But mostly because of my stuttering
                in speech, which used to shattered by confidence in anything.
                <br><br>
                But I know how to handle them properly.
                So it shouldn't be a major problem anymore.
                <br><br>
                As currently. I'm aiming to make a life worth something,
                in both short-term and long-term.
            </div>
            <div class="qa-head">Q: What's the origin of your username?</div>
            <div class="qa-ans">
                Back to the ancient age, I created a YouTube channel named <span class="span-hl">"mapmaker42"</span>
                because ... I liked Minecraft way too much. And forty-two because ... "420 blaze it."
                It was aimed to be a secondary channel for a prehistoric channel.
                <br><br>
                But later. I decided to stick with secondary one to this very day.
                <br><br>
                As time went by. An account name with number behind started to felt more like a throwaway account, 
                a bot, or a literal child. So I decided to modernize the name by picked only the number, 
                then rolled with <b>"FaultyTwo"</b>, which sounded like "forty-two".
                <br><br>
                "Faulty" was a word I used due to low self-esteem.
